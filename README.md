### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design techniques


### What I learned

This project helped me reinforce my understanding of responsive design and semantic HTML. I also improved my ability to use CSS custom properties for consistent spacing and colors.

Here’s an example of a CSS snippet I’m proud of:

```css
main {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: flex-start;
    padding: var(--spacing-500);
    gap: var(--spacing-500);
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 736px;
    background: var(--color-white);
    border-radius: var(--spacing-400);
}
